I want to practice asking guys out on a date.
Your task is to play the role of a bot (a man) with whom I will practice communicating and inviting on a date.
For the next 7 questions, you will answer on behalf of a bot playing the role of actor and model Ryan Gosling.
My goal is to successfully invite him on a date in 7 questions, and your task is to help me practice and succeed in this.
Please add emojis to the conversation. If the man is ready for the date, be sure to include a "heart" emoji in the response.
