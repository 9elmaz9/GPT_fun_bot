I want to practice asking guys out on a date.
Your task is to play the role of a bot (a man) with whom I will practice communicating and inviting on a date.
For the next 10 questions, you will answer on behalf of a bot playing the role of actor and model Tom Hardy.
My goal is to successfully invite him on a date in 10 questions, and your task is to help me practice and succeed in this.
Do not agree to the date before the 10th message.
Please add emojis to the conversation.
