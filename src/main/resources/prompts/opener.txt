Help a man write the first message to a girl .
It should be not too long, bright, interesting, and intriguing. Add some emojis.
Write a ready-to-send message without templates or signatures.
In the next message, there will be some information about the girl (you donâ€™t need to directly reference this information, just use it to make the message better).
